To code an FPS game in Unity, you will need to:
Create a new Unity project.
Import the necessary assets, such as a player character model, weapon models, and a level environment.
Create a player controller script. This script will handle the player's movement, input, and shooting.
Create a weapon script. This script will handle the weapon's firing mechanics, such as reloading and bullet damage.
Create a level script. This script will handle the level's layout, enemies, and other gameplay elements.
Set up the scene by placing the player character, enemies, and other objects in the level.
Test the game and make adjustments as needed.
Here is a simple example of a player controller script in C#:
C#
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float movementSpeed = 5.0f;
    public float jumpForce = 10.0f;

    private Rigidbody rigidbody;

    void Start()
    {
        rigidbody = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }

    void Update()
    {
        // Movement
        float horizontalInput = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float verticalInput = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

        Vector3 movementVector = new Vector3(horizontalInput, 0.0f, verticalInput);
        movementVector = movementVector.normalized * movementSpeed;

        rigidbody.MovePosition(rigidbody.position + movementVector * Time.deltaTime);

        // Jumping
        if (Input.GetButtonDown("Jump"))
        {
            rigidbody.AddForce(Vector3.up * jumpForce, ForceMode.Impulse);
        }
    }
}

This script will allow the player to move around the level and jump. You can add additional features, such as shooting and reloading, by adding additional code to the script.
Once you have created the player controller script, you can attach it to the player character object in the scene. You can then add additional scripts to the scene, such as a weapon script and a level script.
Once you have set up the scene and added the necessary scripts, you can test the game and make adjustments as needed. You can add enemies, obstacles, and other gameplay elements to the level to make the game more challenging and fun.
Coding an FPS game in Unity can be a challenging task, but it is also a rewarding one. With a little bit of effort, you can create your own unique and exciting first-person shooter game.
